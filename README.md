TPED's Discord bot is a custom-made Discord bot created for the purpose of facilitating covnersation between members of the TPED Discord server.  Using various commands that can be explained through !help, members with the "E-Board" role will have the ability to add and delete entries to TPED Bot's SQLite database.  

The bot will intermittenly pull from its database and message users in a designated channel, opening conversation around the topic.  The default rate is one new discussion per 3 days, but this setting can be changed at any point. !get immediately triggers a new discussion.
